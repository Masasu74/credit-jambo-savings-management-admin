      Before generating or updating a page, inspect the existing files of the same type (controllers, routes, models, pages)
      in the project. Mirror their structure, use their naming conventions, replicate their code organization style, and 
      ensure consistent patterns in logic and layout. Do not introduce new styles or formats unless necessary or approved.
